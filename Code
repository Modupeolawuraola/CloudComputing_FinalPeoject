1. What are the areas with the highest risk of wildfires?

Code: 
SELECT STATE
FROM fema_nri_data 
GROUP BY STATE
HAVING AVG(WFIR_RISKS) > 75.00;


SELECT COUNTY, STATE 
FROM fema_nri_data 
GROUP BY COUNTY,STATE
HAVING AVG(WFIR_RISKS) > 75.00;


SELECT TRACT, COUNTY, STATE 
FROM fema_nri_data
GROUP BY TRACT, COUNTY, STATE
HAVING AVG(WFIR_RISKS) > 75.00;


2. What are the areas with the greatest Expected Annual Loss due to wildfires?

Code: 
SELECT STATE, SUM(WFIR_EALT) AS Total
FROM fema_nri_data
GROUP BY STATE
ORDER BY Total DESC
LIMIT 10;

SELECT COUNTY,STATE,SUM(WFIR_EALT) AS Total
FROM fema_nri_data
GROUP BY COUNTY, STATE
ORDER BY Total DESC
LIMIT 10;

SELECT TRACT,STATE, SUM(WFIR_EALT) AS Total
FROM fema_nri_data
GROUP BY TRACT, STATE
ORDER BY Total DESC
LIMIT 100;


3. How many counties are at risk of wildfires? 

Code: 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT county) AS counties_at_risk
FROM fema_nri_data
WHERE wfir_riskr IN ('High', 'Very High');


4. Where are areas with the highest Expected Annual Loss for buildings impacted by wildfires?

Code: 
WFIR_EALB (buildings)
 
SELECT STATE, COUNTY, SUM(WFIR_EALB) AS Total
FROM fema_nri_data
GROUP BY STATE, COUNTY
ORDER BY Total DESC
LIMIT 10;



5. What are the most at risk areas in the US due to ALL climate events?

Code: 
RISK_SCORE (0-100)

SELECT state, county, AVG(wfir_risks) AS total_wildfire_risk
FROM fema_nri_data
WHERE wfir_riskr IN ('Very High', 'High')
GROUP BY state, county
ORDER BY total_wildfire_risk DESC
LIMIT 10;

How many wildfires: WFIR_EVNTS

Code: 
SELECT COUNT(WFIR_EVNTS) AS total_wildfires
FROM fema_nri_data
WHERE WFIR_EVNTS IS NOT NULL;
